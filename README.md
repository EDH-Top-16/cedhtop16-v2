## How to Contribute
After cloning this repository, contact Jason for instructions on building the database. Becasue we rely on external APIs, our database update scripts don't work as-is. We're working on a script to pull form the EDHTop16 main database.

### Start Backend
[`server/`](/server/)
```
cd ./server/
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Start Frontend
[`client/`](/client/)
```
cd ./client/
npm install
npm run dev
```

When submitting pull requests, please inform us if you've added any new packages and update the corresponding package lock files.
